# 2. Receiving samples

A _Sample_ contains information about the material upon which the sequencing
experiments are to be based. Samples can be used in any number of sequencing
_Experiments_ in the form of a _Library_ that is processed further into
single or pooled _Dilutions._

Every received Sample must have an _Identity_. The Identity corresponds to the
individual or organism from whom the sample originated, i.e. the donor. MISO
requires you to assign an external name, which is usually an identifier from
another institution like a Donor ID.

When material is received for sequencing, it can be in many different forms,
called _Sample Classes_ in MISO. Here are the classes of Sample that can be
received:

* Tissue
* Curls
* LCM Tube
* Slides
* gDNA (untreated or whole genome amplified)
* cDNA
* whole RNA
* Single Cell

Depending on which Sample Class is chosen, more or fewer fields appear on the
_Create Sample_ page.

In this workshop, we will create six Samples with four different Identities in
the Project you created in the last session.

## 2.1 Entering a Tissue

All samples in MISO are entered using the bulk entry screen. We will start by 
entering a single Sample for reference tissue from the Identity `ID1`.

{% include samples-receiving.md detailed=page.is-detailed quantity=page.quantity %}
    1. _External Name_: this is the name of the *individual donor*, whether internal or 
       external. For example, an external name would be "Morgan" (internally we refer to 
       her as plain ol' MORG_0001).
        * Enter `PROJ_ID1` in the _External Name_ field, replacing `PROJ` with your project's
          short name. Record this in your worksheet.  <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png"> 
            * Once you enter an external name, MISO will go and find any existing donors with 
              external name(s) that match this, and will add them to the dropdown menu for the 
              _Identity Alias_ field.
            * If there are no existing donors with the exact external name, the option of 
              `First Receipt (project short name)` will be available. 
            * If more than one option is available in the _Identity Alias_ dropdown, the cell 
              will be displayed with a light purple background.
    1. Select `First Receipt (project short name)` for the _Identity Alias_.
    1. _Donor Sex_: Select any item from the dropdown.
    1. _Tissue Origin_: `Ly (Lymphocyte)`
    1. _Tissue Type_: `R (Reference or non-tumour, non-diseased tissue sample)`
    1. _Times Received_: `1`
    1. _Tube Number_: `1`
    1. _Lab_: Select `BioBank (University Health Network)` from the dropdown.
    1. _Secondary ID_: `BioBankID 1`. This is the Biobank ID or Tube ID.
    It may also be left blank.
    1. _Material_: Select any from the drop-down.
    1. _QC Status_: select `Ready` from the drop down.
1. At the upper right hand side, click _Save_.

Upon saving, a number of fields will be filled in, including the Alias. The Tissue
Alias will be in the form PROJ\_0001\_Ly\_R\_nn\_1-1: (Project Short
Name)\_(Individual ID)\_(Tissue Origin)\_(Tissue Type)\_(Passage number)\_(Times
Received)\_(Tube Number). Passage number is only required for Xenografts and Cell
lines. For more information about Sample nomenclature, see <a
href="https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/GENOMICS/LIMS+Guidelines#LIMSGuidelines-SampleNomenclature"
target="_new">Sample Nomenclature</a> on the GENOMICS wiki.

Record the alias in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png"> 

## 2.2 Automatically created Samples

1. Click the _My Projects_ tab at the top and select your project from the list.
1. Open the _Samples_ section on the _Edit Project_ page to see your newly
created samples.

You can also find your samples by searching on the _Samples_ page or by using the widget
on the MISO front page; however, the widget does not show enough information for the
following exercises.

You only created a single Sample but at least two are in this list: the
Reference tissue as well as the Identity. The Identity sample was automatically
created because you provided an _External name_ that had not been previously
used in this Project, and has a name in the format (Project short
name)\_(Individual number), e.g. PROJ_0001. Other types of Samples are created automatically depending
on how you propagate them through to libraries. Some of them will be addressed
in the following tutorials.

## 2.3 Entering bulk Tissues

Next, we will create four more Tissue Samples for individuals 1-5.

1. If you are still on the Project page from section **2.2**, click the _Create_
   button at the top left of the Samples table and continue to step 2. Otherwise:
    1. On the left hand menu under _Preparation_, click _Samples_.
    1. Click the _Create_ button at the top left of the table.
1. Select Sample Class _Tissue_ and Quantity _4_.
1. Click _Create_.

A table will appear with the requested number of samples in table format. We
will fill in the first row and use the quick-fill option to fill in the rest of
the table.

Enter the following values into the **first row only**.

1. _Sample Name_: leave blank. This will be automatically generated after save.
1. _Sample Alias_: leave blank. Again, this will be automatically generated from
the rest of the table.
1. Select or enter the following data in the first row:
  * _Date of Receipt_: select a date
  * _Sample Type_: select `GENOMIC` from the drop-down.
  * _Project_: if you chose to create new samples from the Project page,
    the project will already be entered. If you chose to create new samples
    from the Samples page, select your project from the drop-down.
  * _Donor Sex_: select any item from the drop-down.
  * _Tissue Origin_: select `Br (Breast)` from the drop-down.
  * _Tissue Type_: select `P (Primary Tumour)` from the drop-down.
  * _Times Received_: 1
  * _Tube Number_: 1
  * _Lab_: select `BioBank (University Health Network)` from the drop-down.
  * _Secondary ID_: enter `BioBankID 1`.
  * _Material_: Select any item from the drop down.
  * _QC Status_: Select `Ready` from the drop down.


Now we will fill in the rest of the table. Like in Excel, you can fill down a
column by double-clicking the square in the lower right hand corner of a selected
cell. You can also click and drag to only fill in a certain number of cells.

<table border="1"><tr><td>
<img src="pics/fill-down-1.png"/>
</td><td>
<img src="pics/fill-down-2.png"/>
</td></tr></table>

1. Click the _Date of Receipt_ cell in the first row. A blue square will appear at
   the lower right hand corner of the cell. Double click it to fill in the rest of the
   column with the same date.
1. Fill in the columns in the same way for: _Sample Type_, _Project_, _Donor Sex_,
   _Tissue Origin_, _Tissue Type_, _Times Received_, _Tube Number_, _Material_, and
   _QC Status_.
1. _Description_: Copying and pasting from Excel and Word is supported. 
   Copy something from anywhere and press Ctrl+V (Windows & Linux) or Command+V (Mac)
   on your keyboard to paste.

1. _Matrix Barcode_: you would normally use a hand-scanner or copy and paste a list of 
barcodes from a spreadsheet. For each sample, select a barcode, scan or type it in, and record 
it in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
1. _External Name_:  Again, this is the name of the *individual*, whether internal or external.
Here's a suggested list. Replace `PROJ` with your own project short name.
    - `PROJ_ID1`
    - `PROJ_ID2`
    - `PROJ_ID3`
    - `PROJ_ID4`
  1. Because you've already created an Identity with the external name `PROJ_ID1`, it is found as a match
to the external name you entered for the top row. In the `Identity Alias` dropdown menu for the first row,
select the existing Identity.
  1. Select `First Receipt` from the dropdown menu in each remaining cell of the `Identity Alias` column. 

Some fields cannot be filled down, so enter each of those separately. If you
have a label with an incrementing number (_e.g._, `1`, `2`), enter two rows, select them, 
then double click the blue square.

1. _Secondary ID_: enter `BioBankID 2` in the second row. Select the _Secondary Identifier_
fields for rows 1 and 2, then double click the blue square to fill down rows 3 and 4.
1. Click _Save_ at the upper right hand corner.

If everything is correct, the _Sample Alias_ and _Sample Name_ will be auto-generated for each row and
the samples will be saved. 
Record the external name, sample class, alias, and barcode in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
If you navigate back to your _Edit Project_ page, there should be nine Samples:

* 4 Identity Samples
* 5 Tissue Samples (1 Reference and 4 Primary Tumor)

## 2.4 Receiving Stock DNA/RNA

The process for receiving Stock DNA is very similar to receiving
tissue. Every stock derives from a Tissue, which originated from an
Identity. MISO will create the tissue for you when you enter a Stock. These
samples are known as _ghost samples_, which do not exist at OICR but are in MISO
for sample tracking purposes.

In this section, we will 'receive' a single Stock DNA tube from the reference
material of an existing Identity.


<img src="pics/flow-stock-rx.svg"/>

1. On the left hand menu under _Preparation_, click _Samples_.
1. Click the _Create_ button at the top left of the table.
1. Select Sample Class _gDNA (stock)_ and Quantity _1_.
1. Click _Create_.
1. In the table, enter or select the following:
  * _Sample Name_: leave blank. This will be auto-generated after save.  
  * _Sample Alias_: leave blank. This will be auto-generated based on other
    information in this table.
  * _Description_: `Stock 1`.
  * _Date of receipt_: select a date.
  * _Sample Type_: select `GENOMIC` from the drop-down.
  * _Project_: Select your project.
  * _Scientific Name_: `Homo sapiens`.
  * _External Name_: `PROJ_ID2` (where `PROJ` is your project's short name) .
  * _Identity Alias_: The existing identity should be selected automatically 
    in the dropdown menu.
  * _Tissue Origin_: `nn (Unknown)`
  * _Tissue Type_: `R (Reference or non-tumour, non-diseased tissue sample)`
  * _Times Received_: `1`
  * _Tube Number_: `1`
  * _Lab_: `BioBank (University Health Network)`.
  * _Secondary ID_: `BioBankID 6`.
  * _STR Status_: select any value from the dropdown menu.
  * _Volume_: `300`
  * _Vol. Units_: `µL`
  * _QC Status_: select `Ready` from the dropdown.
1. At the upper right hand side, click _Save_.

When you click 'Save', the alias will be filled in. Record the external identity,
sample class, alias and barcode in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
Stock aliases are created from their tissue alias by appending _\_D\_S#_ or _\_R\_S#_.
For example, the first DNA stock that derives from a tissue `PROJ_0002_Ly_R_nn_1-1` has
the name `PROJ_0002_Ly_R_nn_1-1_D_S1`.

After saving, go back to your project page and look at the samples that were
automatically created. Although you received Stock DNA, it has created a Tissue
for you as well.

1. Click on the Tissue with the alias similar to `PROJ_0002_nn_R_nn_1-1`.

At the top, you will see a grey section with the warning: "This entity does not
exist except for sample tracking purposes!". This message means that the Tissue
does not exist in a freezer at OICR. Eventually these _ghost samples_ will be
hidden from the MISO interface.




# 2.5 Scanning tissues and stocks into a Box

In this section we will add the stocks and tissues you just received into your
inbox for further work. 

{% include inboxes.md %}

<a name="props" href="#" id="toplink">top</a>

# 3. Propagating Samples

Samples in MISO exist for each step of the sample preparation process: from identity,
to tissue, optionally through tissue preparation, to stock, to aliquot. At each
step, the possible options are limited based on the established workflows.
Group IDs may be assigned at any time and are copied when propagating. Different
QC information is available at each step. For instance, STR status is attached
to the stock.

<img src="pics/flow-stock.svg"/>

## 3.1 Propagating to Tissue Processing

Tissue processing is an optional step between the Tissue and Stock levels of the
sample hierarchy. It includes steps such as slides and laser capture microdissections
created from the tissue.

Create a Slide from one of your Tissue samples.

1. On the _Samples_ page, enter your project name in the search box.
1. Check the box for the lymphocyte reference tissue you created in exercise 2.1.
(_e.g._ `PROJ_0001_Ly_R_nn_1-1`)
1. Click _Propagate_ button at the top left of the table.
1. Enter _1_ replicates to _Slide_.
1. Click _Propagate_.
1. Fill out the table:
  * _Description_: CV Slides
  * _Slides_: 3
  * _Discards_: 0
  * _Stain_: Cresyl Violet
  * _QC Status_: Ready
1. Click _Save_.

Upon successful save, a green status will show at the top that says "Saved 1
items". The Sample Alias will have been filled in with an alias that ends in SL01.
Record the alias in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">

## 3.2 Bulk Propagate Samples

For three of the tissue samples created previously (by bulk entry), we will
create stocks for library preparation.

1. On the _Samples_ page, enter your project name in the search box.
1. Check the boxes for any three of the the tumor tissue samples (not the reference tissues)
that you created in section 2.3. They will have names that end with `_Br_P_nn_1-1`.
1. Click _Propagate_ button at the top left of the table.
1. Enter _1_ replicates to _gDNA (stock)_.
1. Click _Propagate_.
1. Fill out the table:
  * _Description_: Free text description. In this case, use "Stock (Tissue
  Type)(Individual)". (e.g. `Stock P2` for `PROJ_0002_Br_P_nn_1-1`)
  * _Matrix Barcode_: choose a barcode for each stock and record it on your worksheet.<img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
  * _STR Status_: select any value from the drop-down
  * _Volume_: `300`
  * _Vol. Units_: `µL`
  * _QC Status_: `Not Ready`
1. Click _Save_.

Upon successful save, a green status will show at the top that says "Saved 3
items". The Sample Alias will have been filled in with aliases that end in D_S1
(for each first DNA stock of that tissue). Record the aliases in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">

## 3.3 Bulk Editing
Samples can be edited in bulk. Assume that we have done some quality control
and wish to update the QC status of the samples.

In this case we will update several fields of 4 stock samples. We will use the
stocks we entered in the previous step as well as the reference stock entered in
part 2.4 of this tutorial.

1. Select the samples you wish to edit:
  * If you are continuing from the end of section **3.2 Bulk Propagate Samples**, do not
  navigate away from the page. At the top left of the table after saving samples, click
  the _Edit_ button. Continue to step 2. Otherwise, select samples using the following:
    1. On the _Samples_ page, enter your project name in the search box.
    1. Check the boxes for the stock samples (propagated and received) that you created in
    sections 2.4 and 3.2. These are the samples with aliases that end with `_D_S1`.
1. Click the _Edit_ button at the top left of the table.
1. Add a _Concentration_ value: any number
1. Change the _QC Status_ column to `Ready` for all rows.
1. Enter a _Matrix Barcode_ for the stock entered in section 2.4 and record it on your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
1. Click _Save_.

Upon successful save, a green status will show at the top that says "Saved 4
items.".

## 3.4 Creating Aliquots
Propagate again from the 4 _gDNA (stock)_ samples to _gDNA (aliquot)_.

1. If you are continuing from the end of section **3.3 Bulk Editing**, do not
  navigate away from the page. 
    1. At the top left of the table after saving samples, click the _Propagate_ button. 
    1. Enter _1_ for the number of replicates (child samples to be created from each parent)
    and _gDNA (aliquot)_ for the type of child sample. Continue to step 3.
1. Otherwise, select samples using the following:
    1. On the _Samples_ page, enter your project name in the search box.
    1. Check the boxes for the stock samples. They will have names that end in
    `_D_S1`.
    1. Click the _Propagate_ button at the top of the table.
    1. A dialog will appear. Select _1_ replicate of _gDNA (aliquot)_ and click _Propagate_.
1. Fill out the table:
  * _Sample Alias_: Skip this field. It will be automatically filled in upon
  save.
  * _Description_: Free text description. In this case, use "Aliquot (Tissue
  Type)(Individual)". (e.g. `Aliquot P2` for `PROJ_0002_Br_P_nn_1-1_D_S1`)
  * _Matrix Barcode_: choose a barcode for each aliquot and record it on your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
  * _QC Status_: Select `Ready`
  * _Purpose_: Select `Library`
1. Click _Save_.

Upon successful save, a green status will show at the top that says "Saved 4
items". Buttons to allow editing the samples or propagating them will show at the top of
the table. The Sample Alias will have been filled in with aliases that end in D\_1
(for each first aliquot of that stock). Record these on your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">


<img src="pics/flow-aliquot.svg"/>


<a name="qcs" href="#" id="toplink">top</a>

# 4. Sample QCs

Several QC methods are supported in MISO. The same process can be used to add
QCs to a single or multiple samples at once.

## 4.1 Adding Sample QCs

{% include samples-bulk-qc.md section=page.section %}

The QCs will now be visible on the sample's individual page.

1. On the _Samples_ page, enter your project name in the search box.
1. Click one of the sample you previously selected.
1. In the _QCs_ table, the Qubit results should now appear in the QCs table.


<a name="boxes" href="#" id="toplink">top</a>

# 5. Scanning aliquots into outboxes

{% include outboxes.md %}


<a name="trouble" href="#" id="toplink">top</a>

# Troubleshooting

{% include samples-trouble.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}

**How do you work with multiple samples derived from the same identity (i.e. DNA and RNA from one tissue slide, DNA from metastasis and control)**

On the _Samples_ page, you can enter the identity's alias into the search box to filter the list.
If the samples you are looking for have more of their alias in common, you can enter as much as
they share to further narrow the search. e.g. to find all stock samples made from tissue
`PROJ_0001_Ly_R_nn_1-1`, you could search for "PROJ_0001_Ly_R_nn_1-1_D_S".

Once you have found all of the samples you wish to work with, select them by clicking the
checkboxes on the left, and choose a bulk action from the menu at the bottom.

**How do I correct a sample that has the wrong information, e.g. wrong tissue type?**

Most sample attributes may be modified either individually, or in bulk. To access the
_Edit Sample_ page for a single sample, click the sample's name or alias on the _Samples_ page.
To bulk edit a set of samples, click the checkboxes next to them on the _Samples_ page and click
_Edit_ at the top left of the table.

For attributes which cannot be changed via MISO (e.g. Sample Class), please email gsi@oicr.on.ca
or file a JIRA ticket in GSI Common to get assistance from the MISO team.

**What if I need to change the parent of a sample? (e.g. for swaps)**

Please email gsi@oicr.on.ca or file a JIRA ticket in GSI Common to get assistance from the MISO team.

**How can I add a new lab, tissue material, tissue type, tissue origin, or add anything else in drop-down menus?**

Some of these items can be added directly:

1. From the _Institute Defaults_ section of the menu, click the category of interest.
1. Click _Add_ from the toolbar.
1. Enter the appropriate information.
1. Click _Create_.

For items that you are not able to add via _Institute Defaults_, Please email gsi@oicr.on.ca
or file a JIRA ticket in GSI Common to get assistance from the MISO team.
