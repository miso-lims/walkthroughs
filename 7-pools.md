title: 7. Dilutions, Pools, and Orders
---

A library cannot be directly loaded into a _lane_ in a _sequencing container_
(flowcell/SMRTcell) in MISO. A dilution must be made and then many dilutions
(or just one) can be mixed into a _pool_ for sequencing.

_Orders_ are requests for sequencing pools a certain number of times. They are
used to keep track of sequencing progress for project management and book-keeping. 

## 7.1 Bulk creating Library Dilutions
Dilutions can be made in bulk from libraries.

In this exercise, we will create 4 library dilutions from the libraries we
made previously.

1. On the _Libraries_ page, check all the libraries just created.
  - `PROJ_0001_Br_P_PE_300_EX`
  - `PROJ_0001_Ly_R_PE_300_EX`
  - `PROJ_0002_Br_P_PE_300_EX`
  - `PROJ_0002_Ly_R_PE_300_EX`
1. From the _Bulk actions_ drop down, select _Make dilutions from selected_ and click _Go_.
1. Enter the concentrations of the dilutions (use any number you wish).
1. Click _Save_.

Dilutions are a bit ephemeral in MISO: there is no list for all the dilutions.
To see the dilutions for a library, view the library page. At present,
Dilutions cannot be saved in Boxes.

## 7.2 Pools
Pools are the last step for libraries before sequencing and represent the
entity that is loaded onto the flowcell lane or SMRTcell. A "pool" can have one or more
library dilutions in it. They are equivalent to "worksets" in Geospiza, but are
required for every lane of sequencing.

Here we will all all of the dilutions we added previously to make a single pool
of 4.

1. On the _Pools_ page, under the _Illumina_ tab, select _Options_ → _Add Pool_.
1. Enter the _Pool Information_:
  1. _Alias_: A short description of the pool contents. Enter the project name
followed by `_POOL` (e.g. `PROJ_POOL`)
  1. _Description_: A longer free-text description of the pool. 
  1. _Platform Type_: Leave `Illumina` selected.
  1. _Desired Concentration_: Enter a concentration.
  1. _Creation Date_: Select a date.
  1. _Ready to Run_: Whether or not the pool is ready for sequencing. This flag
     is used together with the Order to show the pool is ready to be sequenced.
     Tick this box.
  1. _Volume_: Enter a pool volume.
1. In the _Pooled Elements_ section, use the search box to find the dilutions created previously.
1. For each dilution, press the _+_ button to add the dilution to the pool.
1. Click _Save_.

## 7.3 Creating an Order
Orders are created on the pool to be sequenced, and include the quantity of sequencing
required (counted in lanes/SMRT cells), and the sequencing chemistry
required (on Illumina).

1. On the Edit Pool page for the pool you just created, scroll down to the
_Orders_ heading.
1. Fill in the new order box:
  - _Partitions_: the number of lanes/cells that should run for this pool. Enter
`2`
  - _Platform_: Select the instrument for sequencing. `Illumina - Illumina HiSeq 2500`
  - _Sequencing Parameters_: Select `v4 2×126` chemistry.
1. Click _Add_. The order will now be visible in the _Orders_ section.

### 7.3.1  Checking for unfulfilled orders
The _Orders_ page is used to decide what needs to be sequenced.

1. From the navigation menu, choose _Orders_.
1. Verify that the pool you just created is listed in the _Unfulfilled_ tab.

Columns on this page will disappear if there are no entries (_e.g._,
the _Failed_ column will not be shown if there are no failed runs). When enough
lanes have been sequenced, the row will disappear from the _Unfulfilled_ tab,
but remain in the _All_ tab. Lanes currently being sequenced will be marked as
in-progress and remain on the _Unfulfilled_ tab until the run transitions to
_Completed_.

A pool can have many orders. Orders for the same platform and chemistry are
summed when displayed on this page.
