# 2. Propagating samples to libraries

A _library_ is made from one sample for a single target _platform_ and
has a specific _design_ associated with it that decides the _selection_
and _strategies_ used to make the library. A library may also have _indices_
(primers/sequencing barcodes/molecular IDs) and QC information.

## 2.0 Scan samples into your inbox

First, we accept the samples made by the samples team and put them into your
inbox.

{% include inboxes.md %}

{% include libraries-from-samples.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}

{% include libraries-qc.md %}

<a name="boxes" href="#" id="toplink">top</a>

# 4. Scanning libraries into your outbox

Scan the libraries you just created into the outbox for the sequencing team to
use.

{% include outboxes.md %}


{% include libraries-to-dilutions.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}


{% include libraries-dils-to-pools.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}


{% include libraries-orders.md %}


{% include libraries-trouble.md %}
