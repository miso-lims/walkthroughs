# 2. Checking for unfulfilled orders
 
The _Orders_ page is used to decide what needs to be sequenced.

1. From the navigation menu, choose _Outstanding Orders_.
1. Verify that the pool you just created is listed.

Columns on this page will disappear if there are no entries (_e.g._,
the _Failed_ column will not be shown if there are no failed runs). When enough
lanes have been sequenced, the row will disappear from the _Outstanding Sequencing Orders_ page,
but remain in the _All Sequencing Orders_ page. Lanes currently being sequenced will be marked as
in-progress and remain on the _Outstanding_ tab until the run transitions to _Completed_.

A pool can have many sequencing orders. Orders for the same platform and chemistry are
summed when displayed on this page.
