# 3. Receiving Libraries

Propagating libraries from samples is only possible if there are existing samples to propagate from,
and only makes sense if the libraries were prepared in-house. Libraries may also be received without
the samples. The sample information is still required, but it can all be entered in one step.

{% if include.detailed == true %}
When a library is entered in this way, the automatically-created sample hierarchy will include an
Identity, Tissue, Stock, and Aliquot. Existing Identities and Tissues may be included in the hierarchy
if they match the data entered.
{% endif %}
