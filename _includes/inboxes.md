Boxes hold samples, libraries, dilutions, and pools. They do not track 
reagents or primers. Boxes are separated into _uses_ for different kinds
of storage (_e.g._, tissue samples versus extracted DNA), but there is no
check that items in a box match. Each box also has a _size_ that includes
the physical dimensions of the box as well as whether the box is compatible
with the VisionMate scanner. Every _position_ in the box is identified
by a standard row letter + column number format (_e.g._, C05).

---------------------------

In this exercise, we are going to take tissues/samples/libraries from the
previous team/collaborator by scanning them out of the previous box and into a
newly created 'inbox'. 

First, create a new box. This box will be your 'inbox'.

1. From the navigation panel, choose _Boxes_.
1. Click _Add_ at the top right of the table.
1. In the _Create Boxes_ dialog, leave the _Quantity_ at 1 and click _Create_.
1. On the _Create Box_ page, enter the following information:
  1. Alias: A short name for the box. Record this name in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
  1. _Description_: a human description of the box purpose  `gDNA ready for
    library prep for <project>`.
  1. _Box Use_: The contents of the box. Select an appropriate use for your entities.
  1. _Box Size_: Select `8 x 12 scannable`.
1. Click _Save_.

Upon clicking save, a graphic of the box will appear.

You can now fill the box with the tissues, stocks, aliquots, libraries, dilutions, or
pools that were made in previous steps. Collect the appropriate matrix tubes/barcodes now.

1. Click on a position in the displayed _Contents_ grid.
1. Enter a matrix barcode into the _Search_ box on the right and click _Lookup_.
Normally a hand scanner would be used. You can also search for items by their
name or alias
1. Click _Update Position_. 
  * &#9888; The _Save_ button at the top of the page does not work for
    individual positions, only for _Box Information_.
1. Repeat for as many samples/libraries/dilutions/pools as you want.

The table below the box diagram shows the position and information for the
currently selected sample. If you would like to see all of the samples in the
table, click the _List all Box Contents_ button at the top right of the table.

In the lab, it is possible to use _Options_ > _Scan Box_ to use the plate
scanner and update all positions at once, but that will not be covered in this
tutorial.

## Using Boxes

Boxes can be found either from the Sample or Library page or the _Boxes_ page.

1. On the _Samples_ or _Libraries_ page, search for one of your sample or library aliases
   and click on its alias to load the page.
1. The Box and position is listed under _Box Location_ in the _Sample Information_
   or _Library Information_ section. Click on the link to go to the Box (e.g.
   `PROJ_OUTBOX, A03`).

Boxes can be used to store Samples, Libraries, Dilutions, and Pools and one box can
store all four types.
