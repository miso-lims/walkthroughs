Boxes hold samples, libraries, and pools. They do not track reagents or
primers. Boxes are separated into _uses_ for different kinds of storage
(_e.g._, tissue samples versus extracted DNA), but there is no check
that items in a box match. Each box also has a _size_ that includes the
physical dimensions of the box as well as whether the box is compatible
with the VisionMate scanner. Every _position_ in the box is identified
by a standard row letter + column number format (_e.g._, C05).

---------------------------

In this exercise, we are going to take tissues/samples/libraries from the
previous team/collaborator by scanning them out of the previous box and into a
newly created 'inbox'. 

First, create a new box. This box will be your 'inbox'.

1. From the navigation panel, choose _Boxes_ and then _Add Box_.
1. On the _Create Box_ page, enter the information:
  1. Alias: A short name for the box. Record this name in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
  1. _Description_: a human description of the box purpose  “gDNA ready for
    library prep for <project>”.
  1. _Use_: The contents of the box. Select an appropriate use for your entities.
  1. _Size_: Select `8 x 12 scannable`.
1. Click _Save_.

Upon clicking save, a graphic of the box will appear.

You can now fill the box with the tissues, stocks, aliquots, libraries, or
pools that were made in previous steps. Collect the appropriate matrix tubes/barcodes now.

1. Click on a position in the displayed _Contents_ grid.
1. Enter a matrix barcode into the box on the right and click _Lookup_.
1. Click _Update Position_. 
  * &#9888; The _Save_ button at the top of the page does not work for
    individual positions, only for _Box Information_.
1. Repeat for as many samples/libraries/pools as you want.

The table below the box diagram shows the position and information for the
currently selected sample. If you would like to see all of the samples in the
table, click the _List all Box Contents_ button at the top right of the table.

In the lab, it is possible to use _Options_ > _Scan Box_ to use the plate
scanner and update all positions at once, but that will not be covered in this
tutorial.

## Using Boxes

Boxes can be found either from the Sample or Library page or the _Boxes_ page.

1. On the _Sample_ page, search for one of your sample or library aliases and click on the alias to load the page.
1. The Box and position is listed under _Location_ near the top of the _Sample
Information_ section. Click on the link to go to the Box (e.g. `PROJ_OUTBOX,
A03`).

Boxes can be used to store Samples, Libraries and Pools and one box can store all
three types.
