# 7. Adding Service Records to Instruments

Each instrument can have one or more associated service records.

1. Select _Instruments_.
1. Choose an individual instrument.
1. Use the blue arrow to expand the _Service Records_ section.
1. Click the _Add_ button at the top of the table.
1. Fill in the form as follows:
  * _Title_: a short description of the work (_e.g._, `Remove gremlin from sequencer`)
  * _Description_: a long description of the work (_e.g._, `A gremlin was found outside
    of the terrible 80s movie. It had developed a taste for polymerase.`)
  * _Serviced By_: your name
  * _Service Date_: the current date
1. Click _Save_.

Optionally, you can set an issue start time and mark the instrument as out of service. The
instrument will be listed as out of service until an issue end time is added. If the instrument
has multiple sequencing positions and only one is out of service, that can be specified by
also selecting the position affected.

After saving, it is also possible to attach files to the record. Look under the _Attachments_ heading.
