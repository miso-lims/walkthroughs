# 2. Creating projects

A _Project_ contains information about a set of _Studies_ that may comprise many
different _Samples_, _Experiments_ and _Runs_. Samples are attached to Projects and
they are often processed into _Libraries_ and then _Dilutions_, which are then
_Pooled_ and sequenced. Projects also have Overviews, which hold information about
a Project proposal. In this part of this workshop, we will create projects, set
permissions, and familiarize ourselves with the project overview page.

Projects represent a sequencing effort toward a particular goal, usually led by
a particular group or principal investigator. {{ include.project-example }}

In this workshop, you will make your own project where you will create samples,
libraries and other entities.

Most pages have a "Quick Help" tab at the top right under the Save
button where you can find basic information about the current page.

### 2.1.1 Add a Study (optional)

If you plan to upload your project data to the SRA, you must add a _Study_ to 
your Project.

1. Click on the _Studies_ section to expand the section.
1. Click _Add_ at the top left of the table.
1. Much like creating a Project, enter:
  1. Alias (letters and numbers only): this can have any name, but make sure
it is recognizable as belonging to your Project.
  1. Description: any free-text description
  1. Select a Study Type from the drop-down menu : Unless you are certain of the
sequencing type, select `Other`.
1. Click the _Save_ button at the upper right.


## 2.2 My Projects tab

1. Click again on the _My Projects_ tab. You will see a list of all of the projects
you have access to in MISO.

1. Find the project you just created in the list. You can sort any column in the
table by clicking the column header. You can also search for your project by
any of the displayed columns and the table will filter as you type.
1. Click on the link in the Project Name, Short Name or Alias (they all go to the
same page).


## 2.3 Edit Project page

The _Edit Project_ page is used for viewing basic information about a project as
well as all of the entities associated with that project, such as the samples,
libraries, pools, and runs.

Once you create different entities for your project like _Samples, Libraries,
Library Dilutions, Pools_ and _Runs_, you can view and search them on this page.
Each section can be expanded by clicking on its name or the arrow next to it.
The tables under each section can be sorted by the column header or searched
using the field in the upper right. The _Options_ menu above the search bar
contains actions you can perform on the entities in the project.



### 2.3.1 Add a project overview

_Project Overviews_ specify the origin of a specific set of samples
that are part of the project. For example, if you are receiving some samples
from a clinician and other samples from a hospital, you can enter the expected
numbers of samples from each and indicate how many of them passed quality
control and what stage of preparation has been completed. Project overviews are
optional and only used to indicate overall progress on the _My Projects_ page.

1. Click _Add Overview_ at the right side under the Project Information.
1. In the pop-up, enter a principal investigator (`You Yourname`!)
1. In _No. proposed samples_, enter `5`.
1. Click the _Add Overview_ button.

The _Edit Project_ page will reload and now there will be a table with your name
under the _Project Information_ section. You can fill in other values if you wish, or
leave them blank for now. You can also select the checkboxes below the table to
show that certain stages have been completed. Remember to press the _Save_
button after you are finished editing.


### 2.3.2 Add Project Files

In the _Project Files_ section, you can add attach any necessary documents to the
project (e.g. Project Information form, REB).

1. Click the _Project Files_ section on the Edit Project page.
1. Find a document or image that is appropriate for your study
