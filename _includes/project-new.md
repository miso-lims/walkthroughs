# 2. Creating projects

A _Project_ contains information about a set of _Studies_ that may comprise many
different _Samples_, _Experiments_ and _Runs_. Samples are attached to Projects and
they are often processed into _Libraries_ and then _Library Aliquots_, which are then
_Pooled_ and sequenced. This part of the workshop details creating a new project.

Projects represent a sequencing effort toward a particular goal, usually led by
a particular group or principal investigator. {{ include.project-example }}

In this workshop, you will make your own project where you will create samples,
libraries and other entities.

Most pages have a "Quick Help" tab at the top right under the Save
button where you can find basic information about the current page.

## 2.2 Projects List

1. Click again on the _Projects_ link under _Preparation_ in the menu on the left
   side of the screen. You will see a list of all of the projects in MISO.

   table by clicking the column header. You can also search for your project by
   name, alias, short name, or description by typing text into the _Search_ box at
   the top right and pressing the _Enter_ key on your keyboard.
1. Click on the link in the Project Name, Short Name or Alias column (they all go to
   the same page).


## 2.3 Edit Project page

The _Edit Project_ page is used for viewing basic information about a project as
well as all of the entities associated with that project, such as the samples,
libraries, pools, and runs.

Once you create different entities for your project like samples, libraries,
library aliquots, pools, and runs, you can view and search them on this page.
Each section can be expanded by clicking on its name or the arrow next to it.
The tables under each section can be sorted by clicking the column header or
searched using the field in the upper right.



### 2.3.1 Add Project Files

In the _Project Files_ section, you can attach any necessary documents to the
project (e.g. Project Information form, REB).
