Finally, update the _TUTORIAL\_OUTBOX_ with your samples/libraries/pools to
pass them on to the next team or to put them into storage.

### Removing and discarding tubes

When you have a position selected, you can also either remove the tube from the
box (setting its location to "Unknown") or discard the tube, meaning it has been
used up. Discarding the tube sets the volume of the sample to 0, marks it as
"discarded", and removes it from its box.

1. Click on one of the positions in the box with a tube. The position, alias,
   and barcode will appear to the right or below the box graphic. 
   Right-click on the alias and pick "Open in new tab" to load the details page.
1. Go back to the Box page in the other tab. Make sure the tube is still selected in
   the Box and click _Discard Tube_. Click "OK" in the pop-up.
1. Go to the other tab with the Details page and click the browser refresh
   button. The _Location_ field will show as blank, _Volume_ will be set to 0.0,
   and the _Discarded_ box will be ticked.

### Moving items around in boxes

An item can only exist in one box. If assigned to a new box, it will
disappear from the original.

1. In the current tab, go to the _Boxes_ page, find the _TUTORIAL\_OUTBOX_ box. This box was previously
created by the MISO developers for the tutorial.
1. Choose an empty position and enter one of your barcodes.
1. Click _Search_ and _Update Position_.
1. Go back to your own Box and refresh the page. The sample was removed.
1. Repeat this process for the rest of the samples/libraries that you are transferring to the next team.
