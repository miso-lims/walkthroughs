# 4. Arrays

An Array represents a chip which can have Samples added to it to be run on
an Array Scanner. Arrays can have different layouts depending on the chip model.

# 4.1. Create an Array

1. On the _Arrays_ page, click the _Add_ button
1. Choose _Array Model_ "Infinium MethylationEPIC-8 BeadChip."
1. Enter a unique _Alias_ and _Serial Number_ for your Array
1. Click _Save_. The array must be saved before samples can be added to it
1. Add the samples that you created in the previous exercise to the Array. The user interface is similar to Boxes:
    1. Select an empty position on the array, which will appear as a grey circle
    1. In the _Search_ box to the right, enter the Name, Alias, or Barcode of the
    Sample you wish to add. It is easiest to use the barcodes. If you had a barcoded tube, you could just scan it into
    the search box. For this exercise, just type it in. Your sample barcodes should be in the form "PROJ_1", "PROJ_2",
    etc., where "PROJ" is the short name of your project.
    1. Press _Enter_ or click the _Lookup_ button
    1. Your Sample should appear in the _Results_ dropdown. Click _Update position_
    to add it to the array
1. Repeat for the other samples
