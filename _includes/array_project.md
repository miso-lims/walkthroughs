# 2. Projects

A _Project_ contains information about a set of _Studies_ that may comprise many
different _Samples_, _Experiments_ and _Runs_. Samples are attached to Projects and
they are often processed into _Libraries_ and then _Dilutions_, which are then
_Pooled_ and sequenced. We will create a new project for our Array Samples.
