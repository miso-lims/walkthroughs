# 1. Adding Users

In order to perform the tasks in this section you must be a MISO admin. Email IT and request to be added to the MISO_ROLE_ADMIN Active Directory group.

OICR uses Active Directory authentication for MISO. Users must be added by IT; once added, they can then log in to MISO using their email credentials.

1. Please email ithelpdesk@oicr.on.ca to request that the user be added to MISO LIMS by
making them part of the following Active Directory groups:
    * If the person is to be added as an admin: `MISO_ROLE_ADMIN` and `MISO_ROLE_INTERNAL` groups.
    * If the person is not to be given admin access: `MISO_ROLE_INTERNAL` group.
