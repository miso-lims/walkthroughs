# 8. Creating Pools

Pools are the last step for libraries before sequencing and represent the
entity that is loaded onto the flowcell lane or SMRTcell. A "pool" can have one or more
library aliquots in it. Every lane of sequencing contains only one pool.

## 8.1 Bulk creating a Pool

Here we will pool all of the library aliquots we added previously to make a single pool.

1. On the _Library Aliquots_ page, check the {% if include.detailed == true %}five{% else %}two{% endif %} library aliquots you created.
1. From the toolbar at the top left, click _Pool Together_. Click _Create_ in the dialog.
1. Enter the pool information:
  * _Alias_: A short description of the pool contents. Enter the project
    {% if include.detailed == true %}short{% endif %} name followed by `_POOL`
    (e.g. `PROJ_POOL`)
  * _Description_: A longer free-text description of the pool.
  * _Creation Date_: Select a date.
  * _Concentration_: Enter a concentration.
  * _Conc. Units_: ng/µL
  * _Volume_: Enter a pool volume.
  * _Vol. Units_: µL
1. Click _Save_. Record the Pool alias in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png">
