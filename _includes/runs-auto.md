# 4. Working with automatically created runs
 
About five minutes after an instrument begins imaging, MISO will detect it
and create a _Run_. As sequencing continues, MISO will pull back information
about the quality of the run similar to the on-instrument applications like SAV.
This includes statistics like percent pass filter, the percent of bases with
Qscores over 30, and cluster density.

1. From the _Sequencer Runs_ page, find the run assigned to you for this tutorial.
Click on the run alias to go to the run page.
1. Scroll down to the _Metrics_ section and examine the sequencing metrics for
this run.
