Much like the old Geospiza LIMS, you need to log in to MISO LIMS in order to
make changes to any LIMS entities. Logging in lets us record any changes you
make and also allows us to set appropriate permissions.

If you were able to log in to Geospiza LIMS, you already have the correct
permissions and can proceed to logging in. If you are a new user, you will need
to contact <helpdesk@oicr.on.ca> so that they put you into the appropriate
Active Directory group, `MISO_ROLE_INTERNAL`.

1. Click on <a href="http://miso.gsi.oicr.on.ca"
target="\_new" >http://miso.gsi.oicr.on.ca</a>.
1. Enter your
username (e.g. jdoe) and password and click the Login button.
MISO uses the same username and password as your OICR email account.

If all goes well, you should see the MISO Dashboard and see a message at the
top right: "Logged in as: **jdoe**".
