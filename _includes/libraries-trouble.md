# Troubleshooting

## How do I correct an index on a library?
The index can be changed on either the individual library page or the bulk edit page.

1. From _Tracking_, _Library_, select the library that needs to be changed.
1. If necessary, change _Index Family_. If selected, the indices will be erased.
1. Select the correct index under _Indices_. If the index family supports dual barcoding, another drop down will appear.


## What if I forget to put a library dilution in a pool?
If the library dilution has not been created:

1. From _Tracking_, _Library_, check the library that needs to be added.
1. From the toolbar, click _Make Dilution_.
1. Fill out the new row in the table, then click _Save_.

Once the dilution exists:

1. From _Tracking_, _Pool_, select the pool that needs the additional library dilution.
1. In the _Available Dilutions_ section, enter the library name, library alias, or dilution name in the _Search_ box.
1. Find the correct dilution in the list and check it.
1. Click _Add_ on the toolbar.

## How do I make bulk orders?
Making orders in bulk require the order be consistent for all pools.

1. From _Tracking_, _Pools_, select all the pools needing an order.
1. Click _Create Order_, and enter the information as for a single order.

A new order will be create for each pool with the same information.
