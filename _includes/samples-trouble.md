**How can I delete samples?**

Samples can be deleted from the Samples list page by selecting the samples and clicking _Delete_. A
sample cannot be deleted if it has any child samples or libraries. Only the sample's creator or an
admin can delete a sample. Deleted items are listed on the Deletions list page. Deleting a sample is
permanent and cannot be undone.

**What do I have to enter if receiving a pre-made library?**
 
You do not need to create any samples before receiving a library. Library receipt is detailed in a later
tutorial: [Receiving Libraries]({% if include.detailed == false %}plain-{% endif %}3-0-libraries#receipt)
