# 3. Creating groups and adding users to them

_Groups_ permit fine-grained control over who has view and/or edit access to an
item in MISO. There is a default group in MISO for "all internal users".
There are also groups for Watchers, but these features are not yet fully functional.

## 3.1 Create a Group

To create a new group:

1. Select the _Groups_ link in the left-hand menu.
1. Select the _Add_ button near the top left corner.

The _Create Group_ page will display a number of fields that you can fill in.
1. Enter a unique _Name_. The name must contain only letters or numbers. It
   cannot contain spaces or punctuation.
1. Enter a _Description_ of your group.
1. Select your user as the only member of your group.
1. Click the _Save_ button at the upper right.
