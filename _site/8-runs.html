    <h2>Runs and Sequencing Containers
        
    </h2>
</div>

<p>MISO supports runs from both Illumina and PacBio sequencers (and others that
are no longer used at OICR), so the terms used for instrument runs and
associated libraries are intentionally different from those used by the vendor.
Every time a sequencer is loaded and sequencing begins,
a <em>Run</em> is created. Runs are picked up automatically from the instrument.
A <em>Sequencing Container</em> is the link between the library information and the
instrument Run and contains one or more lanes. Each <em>lane</em> (e.g. Illumina lane,
PacBio SMRT cell) in the container is loaded with exactly one <em>Pool</em>.
Runs and Containers can be associated as soon as the sequencer has started.</p>

<h2 id="viewing-run-statistics">8.1 Viewing Run statistics</h2>
<p>About five minutes after an instrument begins sequencing, MISO will detect it
and create a <em>Run</em>. As sequencing continues, MISO will pull back information
about the quality of the run similar to the on-instrument applications like SAV.
This includes statistics like percent pass filter, the percent of bases with
Qscores over 30, and cluster density.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the <em>Runs</em> page, find the run assigned to you for this tutorial.</li>
</ol>

<p>Under the <em>InterOp Metrics</em> section, you will see a loading animation. After a
few seconds to load, this page will show information from the sequencer about
the run progress.
However, this function does not work reliably under load (as when ~20 people
look at runs at the same time during this tutorial), so it may not load. This
functionality will be redesigned in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="adding-a-sequencing-container-to-a-run">8.2 Adding a sequencing container to a run</h2>

<p>The Run (representing an instrument run) is associated with Pools using a
<em>Sequencing Container</em>.</p>

<p><img src="pics/flow-cell.svg" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>On the Run assigned to you, scroll down to the <em>Containers</em> section.</li>
  <li>Search for the pool you previously created and double click to assign it to
the lane. If you did not tick the <em>Ready to Run</em> box when creating the Pool, you
may need to untick this option next to the search field.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Select Study</em> button on the Lane to accept the default Study.</li>
  <li>If the flowcell is being stored, enter the location.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The validation field is used only by cBot; leave it blank.</p>

<p>Now check on the Order.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <em>Orders</em> page and verify that the <em>Remaining</em> column now
shows 1 for the pool.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="low-quality-sequencing">8.3 Low Quality Sequencing</h3>
<p>Not every library realises its full potential. After sequencing, specific
libraries can be flagged as having low sequencing quality. The
&quot;Low Quality Sequencing&quot; indicator causes any pool containing this library to be
flagged, so that it can be checked before it is sequenced again.</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the <em>Libraries</em> page, find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0002_Ly_R_PE_300_EX</code> library
and click the link.</li>
  <li>Check <em>Low Quality Sequencing</em>.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now if the Pool containing that Library is added to a Sequencing Container, it
will be flagged red.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go back to your Run page.</li>
  <li>Find your pool using the search box. It will be flagged red.</li>
</ol>
