<h1 id="logging-in">1. Logging in</h1>
<p>Much like the old Geospiza LIMS, you need to log in to MISO LIMS in order to
make changes to any LIMS entities. Logging in lets us record any changes you
make and also allows us to set appropriate permissions.</p>

<p>If you were able to log in to Geospiza LIMS, you already have the correct
permissions and can proceed to logging in. If you are a new user, you will need
to contact <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#100;&#101;&#115;&#107;&#064;&#111;&#105;&#099;&#114;&#046;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#097;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#100;&#101;&#115;&#107;&#064;&#111;&#105;&#099;&#114;&#046;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#097;</a> so that they put you into the appropriate
Active Directory group, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MISO_ROLE_INTERNAL</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Try to log in now:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on <a href="http://miso.gsi.oicr.on.ca" target="\_new">http://miso.gsi.oicr.on.ca</a>.</li>
  <li>Enter your
username (e.g. jdoe) and password and click the Login button.
MISO uses the same username and password as your OICR email account.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all goes well, you should see the MISO Dashboard and see a message at the
top right: &quot;Logged in as: <strong>jdoe</strong>&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="receiving-samples">2. Receiving samples</h1>

<p>A <em>Sample</em> contains information about the material upon which the sequencing
experiments are to be based. Samples can be used in any number of sequencing
<em>Experiments</em> in the form of a <em>Library</em> that is often processed further into
pooled <em>Dilutions.</em></p>

<p>Every received Sample must have an <em>Identity</em>. The Identity corresponds to the
individual or organism with whom the sample originated, i.e. the donor. MISO
requires you to assign an external name, which is usually an identifier from
another institution like a Donor ID.</p>

<p>When material is received for sequencing, it can be in many different forms,
called <em>Sample Classes</em> in MISO. Here are the classes of Sample that can be
received:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cell line</li>
  <li>Tumour tissue (Primary or Metastatic)</li>
  <li>Reference tissue</li>
  <li>Xenograft tissue</li>
  <li>gDNA (untreated or whole genome amplified)</li>
  <li>cDNA</li>
  <li>whole RNA</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on which Sample Class is chosen, more or less fields appear on the
<em>Create Sample</em> page.</p>

<p>In this workshop, we will create six Samples with four different Identities in
the Project you created in the last session.</p>

<p><img src="pics/flow-tissue-rx.svg" /></p>

<h2 id="entering-a-single-tissue">2.1 Entering a single Tissue</h2>

<p>There are two ways of entering Samples into MISO: Single and Bulk. We will start
by entering a single Sample for reference tissue from the Identity <code class="highlighter-rouge">ID1</code>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the left hand menu under <em>Tracking</em>, click <em>Samples</em>.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Add Sample</em> button on the right hand side. There are two tabs
across the top. Ensure that <em>Single</em> is selected.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Sample Information</em> section, enter or select the following:</li>
  <li>Project: Select the project you created in the last exercise.</li>
  <li>Alias: leave blank. This will be auto-generated based on other
information in this form.</li>
  <li>Description: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reference 1</code>.</li>
  <li>Date of Receipt: Select a date</li>
  <li>Scientific Name: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Homo sapiens</code>.</li>
  <li>Sample Type: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENOMIC</code> from the drop down.</li>
  <li>QC Status: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ready</code> from the drop down.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Identity</em> section:</li>
  <li>External names : this is the name of the <em>individual</em>, whether internal or external. 
For example, an external identifier would be &quot;Morgan&quot; (internally we refer to her as plain ol&#39; MORG_0001).
    1. Click <em>Find or Create Identity</em>.
    1. In the pop-up window, enter external name: project short name <code class="highlighter-rouge">_ID1</code> 
(<em>e.g.</em>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_ID2</code>). This is the name given to the donor by the external 
institute that the tissue came from. Record this in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" />
    1. Click <em>Validate External Name(s)</em>.
    1. From the dropdown, select <code class="highlighter-rouge">First Receipt</code>.
    1. Click <em>Select</em>.</li>
  <li>Sex: Select any item from the dropdown.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Details</em> section, select the <em>Sample Class</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reference Tissue</code>. 
Record the class in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li>In the <em>Tissue</em> section, select or enter the following to create a reference Sample.</li>
  <li>Tissue Origin: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ly (Lymphocyte)</code></li>
  <li>Tissue Type: <code class="highlighter-rouge">R (Reference or non-tumour, non-diseased tissue sample)</code></li>
  <li>Tissue Material: Select any from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>External Institute Identifier: <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID 1</code>. This is the Biobank ID or Tube ID.
It may also be left blank.</li>
  <li>Lab: Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBank (University Health Network)</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Times Received: <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
  <li>Tube Number: <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
  <li>At the upper right hand side, click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon saving, a number of fields will be filled in, including the Alias. The
Tissue
Alias will be in the form PROJ_0001_Ly_R_nn_1-1: (Project Short
Name)_(Individual ID)_(Tissue Origin)_(Tissue Type)_(Passage number)_(Times
Received)_(Tube Number). Passage number is only required for Xenografts and Cell
lines. For more information about Sample nomenclature, see <a href="https://wiki.oicr.on.ca/display/GENOMICS/LIMS+Guidelines#LIMSGuidelines-SampleNomenclature" target="_new">Sample Nomenclature</a> on the GENOMICS wiki.</p>

<p>Record the alias in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></p>

<h3 id="enter-a-matrix-tube-barcode">2.1.1 Enter a matrix tube barcode</h3>

<p>After saving the Sample, you will be able to enter the barcode for the tube.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Edit Sample</em> page for the sample you just created, click the arrow next to
the blue <em>ID</em> box at the top right hand corner.</li>
  <li>Select <em>Assign New Barcode</em> from the menu.</li>
  <li>Use the hand-scanner or type a barcode into the pop-up.
Record the barcode in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em> on the pop-up.</li>
</ol>

<p>The page will re-load with the 2D barcode at the top right.</p>

<h2 id="automatically-created-samples">2.2 Automatically created Samples</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <em>My Projects</em> tab at the top and select your project from the list.</li>
  <li>Open the <em>Samples</em> section on the <em>Edit Project</em> page to see your newly
created samples.</li>
</ol>

<p>(You can also find your samples by searching on the <em>Samples</em> page or by
using the widget on the MISO front page. At the moment, searching on the 
<em>Samples</em> page is quite slow but you are welcome to try using that page to view
your samples. The widget is fast but does not show enough information for the
following exercises.)</p>

<p>You only created a single Sample but at least two are in this list: the
Reference tissue as well as the Identity. The Identity sample was automatically
created because you provided an <em>External name</em> that had not been previously
used in this Project, and has a name in the format (Project short
name)_(Individual number), e.g. PROJ_0001. Other types of Samples are created automatically depending
on how you propagate them through to libraries. Some of them will be addressed
in the following tutorials.</p>

<h2 id="entering-bulk-tissues">2.3 Entering bulk Tissues</h2>

<p>Next, we will create four more Samples using the much faster bulk method. The
four samples will be the Primary Tumour Tissue for individuals 1-5.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the left hand menu under <em>Tracking</em>, click <em>Samples</em>.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Add Sample</em> button on the right hand side. There are two tabs
across the top. Ensure that <em>Bulk</em> is selected.</li>
  <li><em>Select project</em> dropdown: select your project.</li>
  <li><em>Select class</em> dropdown: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Primary Tumor Tissue</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Number of samples</em> text box: <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code>.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Make Table</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A table will appear with the requested number of samples in table format. We
will fill in the first row and use the quick-fill option to fill in the rest of
the table.</p>

<p>Enter the following values into the <strong>first row only</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sample Alias: leave blank. Again, this will be automatically generated from
the rest of the table.</li>
  <li>Select or enter the following fields:</li>
  <li>Description: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Primary</code>.</li>
  <li>Date of Receipt: select a date</li>
  <li>Sample Type: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENOMIC</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Sex: select any item from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Tissue Origin: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Br (Breast)</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Tissue Type: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">P (Primary Tumour)</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Times Received: 1</li>
  <li>Tube Number: 1</li>
  <li>Lab: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBank (University Health Network)</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Ext. Inst. Identifier: <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID</code></li>
  <li>Material: Select any item from the drop down.</li>
  <li>QC Status: Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ready</code> from the drop down.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we will fill in the rest of the table. Like in Excel, you can fill down a
column by double-clicking the square at the lower right hand side of a selected
cell. You can also click and drag to only fill in a certain number of cells.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <em>Sample Type</em> cell in the first row. A blue square will appear at
the lower right hand side. Double click it to fill in the rest of the table with
the word &quot;Primary&quot;.</li>
  <li>Fill in the columns in the same way for: <em>Sex</em>, <em>Tissue
Origin</em>, <em>Tissue Type</em>, <em>Times Received</em>, <em>Tube Number</em>, and <em>Material</em>.</li>
</ol>

<table border="1"><tr><td>
<img src="pics/fill-down-1.png" />
</td><td>
<img src="pics/fill-down-2.png" />
</td></tr></table>

<p>Some fields cannot be filled down, so enter each of those separately.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Matrix Barcode</em>: you would normally use a hand-scanner or
copy and paste a list of barcodes from a spreadsheet. 
For each sample, select a barcode and scan or type it in and record it in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li><em>External Name</em>:  Again, this is the name of the <em>individual</em>, whether internal or external.
  Here&#39;s a suggested list. Replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ</code> with your own project name.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_ID1</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_ID2</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_ID3</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_ID4</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <em>Look up Identities</em> (above the top left corner of the table).</li>
  <li>Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">First Receipt</code> from the dropdown menu in each cell of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Identity Alias</code> column. 
Since these are all first receipt, you may fill them down after selecting it in the top row. If 
the identities already existed, you would have to select them individually.</li>
  <li><em>Ext. Inst. Identifier</em>: add a number to each row starting from 2, i.e..
<code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID 2</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID 3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID 4</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID 5</code>.</li>
  <li><em>Description</em>: Copying and pasting from Excel and Word is supported. 
Copy something from anywhere and press Ctrl+V on your keyboard to
paste.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em> at the upper right hand corner.</li>
</ol>

<p>If everything is correct, the <em>Alias</em> will be auto-generated for each row and
the samples will be saved. 
Record the external identity, class, alias and barcode in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" />
If you navigate back to your <em>Edit Project</em> page,
there should be nine Samples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 Identity Samples</li>
  <li>1 Reference Sample</li>
  <li>4 Primary Samples</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice also that if you used the same <em>External Name</em>, ending in <code class="highlighter-rouge">ID1</code>,
for two samples, reference and primary, they have the same Identity.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-stock-dnarna">2.4 Receiving Stock DNA/RNA</h2>

<p>The process for receiving Stock DNA is very similar to receiving
tissue. Every stock derives from a Tissue, which originated from an
Identity. MISO will create the tissue for you when you enter a Stock. These
samples are known as <em>ghost samples</em>, which do not exist at OICR but are in MISO
for sample tracking purposes.</p>

<p>In this section, we will &#39;receive&#39; a single Stock DNA tube from individual 2
reference tumour.</p>

<p><img src="pics/flow-stock-rx.svg" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>On the left hand menu under <em>Tracking</em>, click <em>Samples</em>.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Add Sample</em> button on the right hand side. There are two tabs
across the top. Ensure that <em>Single</em> is selected.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Sample Information</em> section, enter or select the following:</li>
  <li>Project: Select the project you created in the last exercise.</li>
  <li>Alias: leave blank. This will be auto-generated based on other
information in this form.</li>
  <li>Description: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Stock 1</code>.</li>
  <li>Date of receipt: select a date.</li>
  <li>Scientific Name: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Homo sapiens</code>.</li>
  <li>Sample Type: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">GENOMIC</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>QC Status: select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ready</code> from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>Volume (µl): <code class="highlighter-rouge">300</code></li>
  <li>In the <em>Identity</em> section, enter the</li>
  <li>External name : project name <code class="highlighter-rouge">_ID2</code>.</li>
  <li>Sex: Select any item from the dropdown.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Details</em> section, select the <em>Sample Class</em>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">gDNA (stock)</code>.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Tissue</em> section, select or enter the following to create a reference
Sample.</li>
  <li>Tissue Class: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Reference Tissue</code></li>
  <li>Tissue Origin: <code class="highlighter-rouge">nn (Unknown)</code></li>
  <li>Tissue Type: <code class="highlighter-rouge">R (Reference or non-tumour, non-diseased tissue sample)</code></li>
  <li>Tissue Material: Select any from the drop-down.</li>
  <li>External Institute Identifier: <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBankID 6</code>.</li>
  <li>Lab: <code class="highlighter-rouge">BioBank (University Health Network)</code>.</li>
  <li>Times Received: <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
  <li>Tube Number: <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code></li>
  <li>At the upper right hand side, click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you click &#39;Save&#39;, the aliases will be filled in. 
Record the external identity, class, alias and barcode in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" />
Stock aliases are created from their tissue alias by appending <em>_D_S#</em> or <em>_R_S#</em>.
For example, the first DNA stock that derives from a tissue <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0002_Ly_R_nn_1-1</code> has
the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0002_Ly_R_nn_1-1_D_S1</code>.</p>

<p>After saving, go back to your project page and look at the samples that were
automatically created. Although you received Stock DNA, it has created a Tissue
for you as well.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the Tissue  with the alias similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0002_nn_R_nn_1-1</code>. It
should have a <em>Sample Description</em> that says only &quot;Tissue&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the top, you will see a grey section with the warning: &quot;This entity does not
exist except for sample tracking purposes!&quot;. This message means that the Tissue
does not exist in a freezer at OICR. Eventually these <em>ghost samples</em> will be
hidden from the MISO interface.</p>

<h1 id="receiving-libraries">2.5 Receiving Libraries</h1>

<p>#TODO Content here!</p>

<h1 id="propagating-samples">3. Propagating Samples</h1>

<p>Samples in MISO exist for each step in the tissue preparation: from identity,
to tissue, optionally though tissue preparation, to stock, to aliquot. At each
step, the possible options are limited based on the established workflows.
Group IDs may be assigned at any time and are copied when propagating. Different
QC information is available at each step. For instance, STR status is attached
to the stock.</p>

<p><img src="pics/flow-stock.svg" /></p>

<h2 id="propagating-to-tissue-processing">3.1 Propagating to Tissue Processing</h2>

<p>#TODO</p>

<h2 id="bulk-propagate-samples">3.2 Bulk Propagate Samples</h2>

<p>For the tissue samples created previously (by bulk and single entry), we will create stocks for library preparation.</p>

<p>For three of the tissues you created in the previous section, create a stock.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Samples</em> page, enter your project name in the search box.</li>
  <li>Check the boxes for the tissue samples (not the received stock)
that you created in sections 2.1 and 2.3. 
They will
have names that end in two hyphenated numbers, like <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0001_Ly_R_nn_1-1</code>.</li>
  <li>From the <em>Bulk actions</em> dropdown at the bottom, select <em>Propagate (sample) selected</em>.</li>
  <li>A new dropdown will appear. Select <em>gDNA (stock)</em> and click <em>Go</em>.</li>
  <li>Fill out the table:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Description</em>: Free text description. In this case, use &quot;Stock (Tissue
  Type)(Individual)&quot;. (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Stock P2</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0002_Br_P_nn_1-1</code>)</li>
      <li><em>Matrix Barcode</em>: choose a barcode for each stock and record it on your worksheet.<img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
      <li><em>Vol.</em>: <code class="highlighter-rouge">300</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon successful save, a green status will show at the top that says &quot;Saved 3
items&quot;. The Sample Alias will have been filled in with aliases that end in D_S1
(for each first DNA stock of that tissue). Record the aliases in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></p>

<h2 id="bulk-editing">3.2 Bulk Editing</h2>
<p>Samples can be edited in bulk. Assume that we have done some quality control
and wish to update the QC status of the samples.</p>

<p>In this case we will update several fields of 4 stock samples. We will use the
stocks we entered in the previous step as well as the reference stock entered in
part 3 of this tutorial.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Samples</em> page, enter your project name in the search box.</li>
  <li>Check the boxes for the stock samples (propagated and received). 
that you created in sections 2.4 and 3.1.
These are
the samples that end in D_S1.</li>
  <li>From the <em>Bulk actions</em> dropdown at the bottom, select <em>Update selected</em> and click <em>Go</em>.</li>
  <li>Change the <em>QC Status</em> column to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ready</code> for all rows.</li>
  <li>Enter the a <em>Matrix Barcode</em> for the stock entered in section 3.4 and record it on your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon successful save, a green status will show at the top that says &quot;Saved 4
items.&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="creating-aliquots">3.3 Creating Aliquots</h2>

<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Samples</em> page, enter your project name in the search box.</li>
  <li>Check the boxes for the stock samples. They will have names that end in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">D_S1</code>.</li>
  <li>From the <em>Bulk actions</em> dropdown at the bottom, select <em>Propagate (sample) selected</em>.</li>
  <li>A new dropdown will appear. Select <em>gDNA (aliquot)</em> and click <em>Go</em>.</li>
  <li>Fill out the table:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Sample Alias</em>: Skip this field. It will be automatically filled in upon
  save.</li>
      <li><em>Description</em>: Free text description. In this case, use &quot;Aliquot (Tissue
  Type)(Individual)&quot;. (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aliquot P2</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_0002_Br_P_nn_1-1_D_S1</code>)</li>
      <li><em>Matrix Barcode</em>: choose a barcode for each aliquot and record it on your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
      <li><em>Purpose</em>: Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Library</code></li>

<p>#TODO customize for samples</p>

<p>Boxes hold samples, libraries, and pools. They do not track reagents or
primers. Boxes are separated into <em>uses</em> for different kinds of storage
(<em>e.g.</em>, tissue samples versus extracted DNA), but there is no check
that items in a box match. Each box also has a <em>size</em> that includes the
physical dimensions of the box as well as whether the box is compatible
with the VisionMate scanner. Every <em>position</em> in the box is identified
by a standard row letter + column number format (<em>e.g.</em>, C05).</p>

<hr />

<p>In this exercise, we are going to put the things in the box that you made in
the previous exercises. Depending on whether you have been creating samples or
libraries, some of these fields will be different.</p>

<p>First, create a new box:</p>

<ol>
  <li>From the navigation panel, choose <em>Boxes</em> and then <em>Add Box</em>.</li>
  <li>On the <em>Create Box</em> page, enter the information:</li>
  <li>Alias: A short name for the box. Record this name in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li><em>Description</em>: a human description of the box purpose  “gDNA ready for
    library prep for <project>”.</project></li>
  <li><em>Use</em>: The contents of the box. Select an appropriate use for your entities.</li>
  <li><em>Size</em>: Select <code class="highlighter-rouge">8 x 12 scannable</code>.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Save</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon clicking save, a graphic of the box will appear.</p>

<p><img src="pics/5-empty-box.png" id="figure" /></p>

<p>You can now fill the box with the tissues, stocks, aliquots, libraries, or
pools you made in previous steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on a position in the displayed <em>Contents</em> grid.</li>
  <li>Enter a matrix barcode into the box on the right and click <em>Lookup</em>.
Normally a hand scanner would be used.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Update Position</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>&#9888; The <em>Save</em> button at the top of the page does not work for
 individual positions, only for <em>Box Information</em>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Repeat for as many samples/libraries/pools as you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>The table below the box diagram shows the position and information for the
currently selected sample. If you would like to see all of the samples in the
table, click the <em>List all Box Contents</em> button at the top right of the table.</p>

<p>In the lab, it is possible to use <em>Options</em> &gt; <em>Scan Box</em> to use the plate
scanner and update all positions at once, but that will not be covered in this
tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="using-boxes">Using Boxes</h2>

<p>Boxes can be found either from the Sample or Library page or the <em>Boxes</em> page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On the <em>Sample</em> page, search for one of your sample or library aliases and click on the alias to load the page.</li>
  <li>The Box and position is listed under <em>Location</em> near the top of the <em>Sample
Information</em> section. Click on the link to go to the Box (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">PROJ_OUTBOX,
A03</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Boxes can be used to store Samples, Libraries and Pools and one box can store all
three types.</p>

<h3 id="removing-and-discarding-tubes">Removing and discarding tubes</h3>

<p>When you have a position selected, you can also either remove the tube from the
box (setting its location to &quot;Unknown&quot;) or discard the tube, meaning it has been
used up. Discarding the tube sets the volume of the sample to 0 and marks it as
&quot;discarded&quot;,and removes it from its box.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on one of the positions in the box with a tube. The position, alias,
and barcode will appear to the right or below the box graphic. 
Right-click on the alias and pick &quot;Open in new tab&quot; to load the details page.</li>
  <li>Go back to the Box page in the other tab. Make sure the tube is still selected in
the Box and click <em>Discard Tube</em>. Click &quot;OK&quot; in the pop-up.</li>
  <li>Go to the other tab with the Details page and click the browser refresh
button. The <em>Location</em> field will show as blank, <em>Volume</em> will be set to 0.0,
and the <em>Discarded</em> box will be ticked.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="moving-samples-around-in-boxes">Moving samples around in boxes</h3>

<p>An item can only exist in one box. If assigned to a new box, it will
disappear from the original.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the current tab, go to the <em>Boxes</em> page, find the <em>TUTORIAL</em> box. This box was previously
created by the MISO developers for the tutorial.</li>
  <li>Choose an empty position and enter one of your barcodes.</li>
  <li>Click <em>Lookup</em> and <em>Update Position</em>.</li>
  <li>Go back to your own Box and refresh the page. The sample was removed.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>#TODO</p>

<ol>
  <li>How do you work with multiple samples derived from the same identity (i.e. DNA and RNA from one tissue slide, DNA from metastasis and control)</li>
  <li>How do I correct a sample that has the wrong information, e.g. wrong tissue type?</li>
  <li>What if I need to change the parent of a sample? (e.g. for swaps)</li>
  <li>What do I have to enter if receiving a pre-made library?</li>
  <li>How can I add a new tissue type, tissue origin,  or add anything else in drop-down menus?</li>
</ol>
