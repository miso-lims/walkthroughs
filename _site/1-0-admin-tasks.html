<h1 id="logging-in">1. Logging in</h1>

<p>Much like the old Geospiza LIMS, you need to log in to MISO LIMS in order to
make changes to any LIMS entities. Logging in lets us record any changes you
make and also allows us to set appropriate permissions.</p>

<p>If you were able to log in to Geospiza LIMS, you already have the correct
permissions and can proceed to logging in. If you are a new user, you will need
to contact <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#100;&#101;&#115;&#107;&#064;&#111;&#105;&#099;&#114;&#046;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#097;">&#104;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#100;&#101;&#115;&#107;&#064;&#111;&#105;&#099;&#114;&#046;&#111;&#110;&#046;&#099;&#097;</a> so that they put you into the appropriate
Active Directory group, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MISO_ROLE_INTERNAL</code>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Try to log in now:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on <a href="http://miso.gsi.oicr.on.ca" target="\_new">http://miso.gsi.oicr.on.ca</a>.</li>
  <li>Enter your
username (e.g. jdoe) and password and click the Login button.
MISO uses the same username and password as your OICR email account.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all goes well, you should see the MISO Dashboard and see a message at the
top right: &quot;Logged in as: <strong>jdoe</strong>&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="creating-projects">2. Creating projects</h1>

<p>A <em>Project</em> contains information about a set of <em>Studies</em> that may comprise many
different <em>Samples</em>, <em>Experiments</em> and <em>Runs</em>. Samples are attached to Projects as
they are often processed into <em>Dilutions</em>, which are then <em>Pooled</em> and sequenced.
Projects also have Overviews, which hold information about a Project proposal.
In this part of this workshop, we will create projects, set permissions, and
familiarize ourselves with the project overview page.</p>

<p>Projects represent a sequencing effort toward a particular goal, usually led by
a particular group or principal investigator. For example, the PCSI project is
sequencing pancreatic tumors, references, cell lines and xenografts as part of
the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and the FFPER project sequences
samples from a bio-bank with a number of different preparations and treatments
in order to determine the impact of each on data quality.</p>

<p>In this workshop, you will make your own project where you will create samples,
libraries and other entities.</p>

<p>Most pages have a &quot;Quick Help&quot; tab at the top right under the Save
button where you can find basic information about the current page.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-project">2.1 Creating a new project</h2>

<p>To create a new project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>After logging in, click the <em>My Projects</em> tab at the top of the MISO
dashboard.</li>
  <li>Select the <em>Add Project</em> button at the top right corner.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Create Project</em> page will display with a number of fields that you can fill out.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ignore Project ID and Name, since they are set by MISO once the Project is saved.</li>
  <li>Enter a unique <em>Alias</em>. The alias is a name, chosen by us, that is associated
with a project. The aliases must be a unique and contain only letters or
numbers. It cannot contain spaces or punctuation. e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">DoIt4Science</code> (be creative!).
Record this alias in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li>Enter a <em>Short Name</em> for your project. The short name should be 2-5 letters in
all CAPS and related to the project alias. This short name will be used to
automatically generate sample and library names. e.g. short name: <code class="highlighter-rouge">DI4S</code>.
Record the short name in your worksheet. <img src="pics/blue_pencil.png" /></li>
  <li>In the <em>Description</em> field, enter <code class="highlighter-rouge">MISO training workshop [Date]</code></li>
  <li>Choose the amount of <em>Progress</em> that your project has accomplished:
    <ul>
      <li>Unknown : I was told to enter this data and I does what they tells me.</li>
      <li>Active : We are receiving/have received samples and are actively working on
 this project.</li>
      <li>Inactive : Project is not yet done, but waiting for external collaborators,
 REB approval, papers to be published, etc.</li>
      <li>Cancelled : Project was scrapped because we did not get funding/samples/REB
 approval.</li>
      <li>Proposed : Project Initiation form has been received and is awaiting go-ahead
 by Genomics leadership.</li>
      <li>Pending : We are waiting for the project to start.</li>
      <li>Approved : Project has been approved by Genomics leadership.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Select the <em>Reference Genome</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Human hg19 random</code>. This should be the primary
species that will be sequenced in the course of the project. Xenografts count
as human.</li>
  <li>In the <em>Permissions</em> section, select <code class="highlighter-rouge">your name</code> from the <em>Owner</em> drop-down.</li>
  <li>Make sure that <em>Allow all internal users access?</em> is selected.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt="Create Project DI4S" src="pics/create-di4s.png" id="figure" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <em>Save</em> button at the upper right.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upon save, you will be taken to the <em>Edit Project</em> page, where you can see the
project you just created. Notice that the Project ID and Name now have values.
The Project ID will be an integer, and the Name will begin with PRO. These are
specific to this project and used by MISO to track the project internally.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-study">2.1.1 Add a Study</h3>

<p>In order to make sure MISO is SRA-compliant, you must add a <em>Study</em> to your Project. Studies are legacy objects that are not really used in the current system, but need to be added anyway.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <em>Studies</em> section to expand the section.</li>
  <li>Hover over the <em>Options</em> menu at the top right of the Studies table, and
click <em>Add new Study</em>.</li>
  <li>Much like creating a Project, enter:</li>
  <li>Alias (letters and numbers only): this can have any name, but make sure
it is recognizable as belonging to your Project.</li>
  <li>Description: any free-text description</li>
  <li>Select a Study Type from the drop-down menu : Unless you are certain of the
sequencing type, select <code class="highlighter-rouge">Other</code>.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Save</em> button at the upper right.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-projects-tab">2.2 My Projects tab</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Click again on the <em>My Projects</em> tab.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will see a list of all of the projects you have access to in MISO.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find the project you just created in the list. You can sort any column in the
table by clicking the column header. You can also search for your project by
any of the displayed columns and the table will filter as you type.</li>
  <li>Click on the link in the Project Name, Short Name or Alias (they all go to the
same page).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="edit-project-page">2.3 Edit Project page</h2>

<p>The <em>Edit Project</em> page is used for viewing basic information about a project as
well as all of the entities associated with that project, such as the samples,
libraries, pools, and runs.</p>

<p>Once you create different entities for your project like <em>Samples, Libraries,
Library Dilutions, Pools</em> and <em>Runs</em>, you can view and search them on this page.
Each section can be expanded by clicking on its name or the arrow next to it.
The tables under each section can be sorted by the column header or searched
using the field in the upper right. The <em>Options</em> menu above the search bar
contains actions you can perform on the entities in the project.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-project-overview">2.3.1 Add a project overview</h3>

<p><em>Project Overviews</em> specify the origin of a specific set of samples
that are part of the project. For example, if you are receiving some samples
from a clinician and other samples from a hospital, you can enter the expected
numbers of samples from each and indicate how many of them passed quality
control and what stage of preparation has been completed. Project overviews are
optional and only used to indicate overall progress on the <em>My Projects</em> page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click <em>Add Overview</em> at the right side under the Project Information.</li>
  <li>In the pop-up, enter a principal investigator (<code class="highlighter-rouge">You Yourname</code>!)</li>
  <li>In <em>No. proposed samples</em>, enter <code class="highlighter-rouge">5</code>.</li>
  <li>Click the <em>Add Overview</em> button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Edit Project</em> page will reload and now there will be a table with your name
under the <em>Project Information</em> section. You can fill in other values if you wish, or
leave them blank for now. You can also select the checkboxes below the table to
show that certain stages have been completed. Remember to press the <em>Save</em>
button after you are finished editing.</p>

<h3 id="add-project-files">2.3.2 Add Project Files</h3>

<p>In the <em>Project Files</em> section, you can add attach any necessary documents to the
project (e.g. Project Information form, REB).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <em>Project Files</em> section on the Edit Project page.</li>
  <li>Find a document or image that is appropriate for your study</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that your project has been created, continue to make your first samples.</p>
