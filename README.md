complete all sections of the tutorial, or just the sections which apply to their
lab tasks.


To configure this document for your own MISO training, first fork this repo.
(You could rename it if you don't want `-oicr` in the repo title)

Then, update the `_config.yml` file, replacing site-specific values.

Finally, deploy the tutorial to
