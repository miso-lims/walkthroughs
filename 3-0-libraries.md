# 2. Propagating aliquots to libraries

A _library_ is made from one sample for a single target _platform_ and
has a specific _design_ associated with it that decides the _selection_
and _strategies_ used to make the library. A library may also have _indices_
(primers/sequencing barcodes/molecular IDs) and QC information.

MISO stores two important pieces of information about how a library was generated:
the _selection_ (e.g., PCR, cDNA) and the _strategy_ (e.g., WGS, WXS,
amplicon). A _design_ captures both a selection and strategy and the list
of allowed designs is limited based on the sample type (_e.g._, a cDNA sample
can only have SM, WT, or MR library designs and these lock the selection and
strategy type accordingly).

## 2.0 Scan aliquots into your inbox

First, we accept the aliquots made by the samples team and put them into your
inbox.

{% include inboxes.md %}

{% include libraries-from-samples.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}


## 2.2 Bulk propagate aliquots to libraries from Box page

In this section, you will use the aliquots created already and create libraries.
These libraries can be sorted based on the parent sample's location within the box,
and indices can be added based on the box position.

1. On the _Boxes_ page, find your box and click on its link.
1. Select all the aliquots in your box by either control-clicking all the aliquots
in the box (command-click on a Mac). If the aliquots are all in one row or column,
you can click on the row/column header to select all items in that row or column. 
Use control-click (or command-click) to select more than one row or column.
1. Click the _Propagate_ button at the top left of the box contents table. If the 
top left of the box contents table indicates that more than one type of element is
selected, de-select the non-aliquot tubes and then click _Propagate_.
1. Choose _1_ replicate.
1. Click _Propagate_.
1. From the bulk libraries table, you can now sort the libraries you are creating
based on their parent sample's position within the box. Sorting can be done by 
rows (`A01`, `A02`, `B01`, `B02`, ...) or columns (`A01`, `B01`, `A02`, `B02`, ...).
  * This may be useful when using the Sciclone robot to create libraries and add 
indices at a particular plate location. Once the libraries are sorted based on the
parent sample's location, the indices can be copy-pasted in the order that the 
robot requires.

# 4. Scanning libraries into your outbox

Scan the libraries you just created into the outbox for the sequencing team to
use.

{% include outboxes.md %}


{% include libraries-to-dilutions.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}


{% include libraries-dils-to-pools.md detailed=page.is-detailed %}


{% include libraries-orders.md %}


{% include libraries-trouble.md %}

## What if I assign a library to the wrong parent aliquot?
Please email gsi@oicr.on.ca or file a JIRA ticket in GSI Common to get assistance from the MISO team.

## How do I change the targeted sequencing type on a library?
Targeted sequencing is connected to the dilution since the same library can be used for multiple targeted sequencing panels.

1. From _Tracking_, _Dilutions_, check the library dilutions that need to be changed.
1. From the toolbar, click _Edit_.
1. Select a new _Targeted Sequencing_ from the list.
1. Click _Save_.

## How can I add a new targeted sequencing type, kit, or anything else in drop-down menus?
For targeted sequencing and indices, please email gsi@oicr.on.ca or file a JIRA ticket in GSI Common to get assistance from the MISO team.

Kits can be added easily:

1. From _Tracking_, _Kits_, select the type of kit you want to add.
1. Click _Create Kit Descriptor_.
1. Fill in the form. The _Stock Level_ is not currently used, so leave it at zero.
1. Carefully select the _Kit Type_ and _Platform_. This will determine what the kit can be used for.
1. Click _Save_.

## How are matrix tube barcodes assigned to tubes?
Barcodes can be assigned on an individual edit page or in bulk.

To change a single library:

1. From _Tracking_, _Library_, select the library that needs to be changed.
1. Clear the field labelled _Matrix Barcode_.
1. Scan the barcode.
1. Click _Save_.

To change many libraries:

1. From _Tracking_, _Library_, check the box beside each library that needs to be changed.
1. From the toolbar, click _Edit_.
1. Select the cell in the _Matrix Barcode_ column for the library and scan the barcode.
1. Repeat for all the libraries.
1. Click _Save_.
